        <h2>Hey there</h2>
        <p class="intro">Pujan here. I'm 20 years old and currently a third year student in SMIT. I have to make a website for my internship and this is the best that i can do.</p>

          <img class="guitar" src="guitar-playing.png" alt="">
          <h3>Guitar Playing</h3>
          <p>I've been playing the guitar for a couple of years now. Can't say I'm particularly good but i can play a few songs and I'm a bit used to fingerstyle and stuff.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="skill-row">
          <img class="con" src="conversation.png" alt="">
          <h3>Communication</h3>
          <p>Although I like to be by myself most of the time, I think I'm pretty good at communicating with others. I always have long conversations with everyone I talk to and generally have a knack for opening people up.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="skill-row">
          <img class="writing" src="poetry.png" alt="">
          <h3>Writing</h3>
          <p>Stories, poems, songs - you name it, I write it. Writing has always been something that has stuck with me through the years. Again, I won't say I'm good, but I think I write pretty well.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="skill-row">
          <img class="game" src="game-console.png" alt="">
          <h3>ML Player</h3>
          <p>I've been playing ML for 5 years now. I've already reached the highest rank, mastered most of the heroes and even participated in a full-blown tournament. So yeah, this is the one time that I'll say I'm good at something, cause i really am good at this game.</p>
